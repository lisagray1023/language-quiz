# Languages of the World Quiz App
Android Basics Nanodegree project for Object Oriented Programming, "Quiz App" on a topic I'm interested in. I work in Localization so I love learning about languages of the world. The app was tested on an LG G6 running Android 7.0.  

Thank you for taking the time to review and for your feedback.
